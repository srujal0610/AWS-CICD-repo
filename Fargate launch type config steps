Steps to configure completely:
1. Create and Push the Dockerfile to ECR Repo
2. Create Task definition with the docker image pushed and mention the port as 3000 in container port
3. create cluster and then service
4. create target group with type IP Address and in Step 2 remove the IP from field : "Specify IPs and define ports"
5. Include the target group in ALB creation and mention the listener port as 80
6. After above all steps if still the new task created are not registered in target group :
  We need to create the service once again by deleting the previous one since new created LB would not be registered auto in service
  so just delete the service from cluster and create new one with Load Balancer registered from Load balancing section.
  After adding  the load balancer , try updating the task definition with quick service update and increase the task definition to see if new task auto registered in LB
